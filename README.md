<p align="left">
I build systems that connect data, processes, and real-world decisions.

Industrial Engineer with a strong foundation in data analysis, process optimization, and software development. 
Currently working as an independent developer, delivering solutions for financial systems, business automation, and data-driven applications.

My work sits at the intersection of <b>data + backend + real operations</b>:
- Designing and building APIs and web systems (.NET, Next.js)
- Working with data extraction, transformation, and analysis (SQL, Power BI, ETL)
- Automating workflows and structuring scalable solutions for real business problems

I have experience handling complex datasets, building internal tools, and creating systems that improve decision-making and operational efficiency.

Currently exploring:
⚡ Energy data & ESG  
⚡ Data pipelines and large-scale processing  
⚡ Backend architecture and system design  

I like solving messy problems where data, systems, and reality collide.
